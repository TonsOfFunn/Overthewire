*** Krypton Level 2 ***

GOAL:
-----
1)  ROT13 is a simple substitution cipher.

    Substitution ciphers are a simple replacement algorithm. 
    In this example of a substitution cipher, we will explore a 
    ‘monoalphebetic’ cipher. Monoalphebetic means, literally, 
    “one alphabet” and you will see why.

    This level contains an old form of cipher called a ‘Caesar Cipher’. 
    A Caesar cipher shifts the alphabet by a set number. For example:

    plain:  a b c d e f g h i j k ...
    cipher: G H I J K L M N O P Q ...

    In this example, the letter ‘a’ in plaintext is replaced by a ‘G’ 
    in the ciphertext so, for example, the plaintext ‘bad’ becomes ‘HGJ’ 
    in ciphertext.

    The password for level 3 is in the file krypton3. It is in 5 letter 
    group ciphertext. It is encrypted with a Caesar Cipher. Without any 
    further information, this cipher text may be difficult to break. 
    You do not have direct access to the key, however you do have access 
    to a program that will encrypt anything you wish to give it using the key. 
    If you think logically, this is completely easy.

    One shot can solve it!

    Have fun.

    Additional Information:

    The encrypt binary will look for the keyfile in your current working 
    directory. Therefore, it might be best to create a working direcory in 
    /tmp and in there a link to the keyfile. As the encrypt binary runs setuid 
    krypton3, you also need to give krypton3 access to your working directory.

    Here is an example:

    krypton2@melinda:~$ mktemp -d
    /tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ
    krypton2@melinda:~$ cd /tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ
    krypton2@melinda:/tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ$ ln -s /krypton/krypton2/keyfile.dat
    krypton2@melinda:/tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ$ ls 
    keyfile.dat
    krypton2@melinda:/tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ$ chmod 777 .
    krypton2@melinda:/tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ$ /krypton/krypton2/encrypt /etc/issue
    krypton2@melinda:/tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ$ ls 
    ciphertext keyfile.dat
