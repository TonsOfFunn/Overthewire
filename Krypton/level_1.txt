*** Krypton Level 1 ***

GOAL:
-----
1)  The password for level 2 is in the file ‘krypton2’. 
    It is ‘encrypted’ using a simple rotation. It is also in non-standard 
    ciphertext format. When using alpha characters for cipher text it is 
    normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters, regardless of word 
    boundaries. This helps obfuscate any patterns. This file has kept the 
    plain text word boundaries and carried them to the cipher text. Enjoy!


HINTS:

2)  $ echo YRIRY GJB CNFFJBEQ EBGGRA | tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]'
