*** Krypton Level 3 ***

GOAL:
-----
1)  Well done. You’ve moved past an easy substitution cipher.

    The main weakness of a simple substitution cipher is repeated use 
    of a simple key. In the previous exercise you were able to introduce 
    arbitrary plaintext to expose the key. In this example, the cipher 
    mechanism is not available to you, the attacker.

    However, you have been lucky. You have intercepted more than one message. 
    The password to the next level is found in the file ‘krypton4’. 
    You have also found 3 other files. (found1, found2, found3)

    You know the following important details:

    The message plaintexts are in English (*** very important) - 
    They were produced from the same key (*** even better!)

    Enjoy.


HINTS:
------

HELP:
-----

SOLUTIONS:
----------
1)  Input found1, found2, found3, & krypton4 into F.A. program
2)  Analyze frequencies to find matches
3)  Use Digraphs & Trigraphs to decipher frequencies
4)  Decrypt krypton4
