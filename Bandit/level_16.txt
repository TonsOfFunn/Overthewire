*** Bandit Level 16 ***

GOAL:
-----
1)  The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting 
    the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using 
    SSL encryption.

    Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof 
    and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ 
    and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…

HINTS:
------
ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap
