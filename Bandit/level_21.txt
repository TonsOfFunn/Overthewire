*** Bandit Level 21 ***

GOAL:
-----
1)  There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: 
    it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline 
    argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it 
    to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, 
    it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

    NOTE: Changes to the infrastructure made this level more difficult. 
    You will need to figure out a way to launch multiple commands in the same 
    Docker instance.

    NOTE 2: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you 
    think.

HINTS:
------
ssh, nc, cat, bash, screen, tmux
