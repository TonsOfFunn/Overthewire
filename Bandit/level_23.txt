*** Bandit Level 23 ***

GOAL:
-----
1)  A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, 
    the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration 
    and see what command is being executed.

    NOTE: Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. 
    The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having 
    problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug 
    information it prints.


HINTS:
------
cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use “man 5 crontab” to access this)

HELP:
-----

SOLUTIONS:
----------
1)  $ cd /etc/cron.d

5)  $ mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
6)  $ echo $mytarget
7)  $ cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
