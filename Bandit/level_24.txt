*** Bandit Level 24 ***

GOAL:
-----
1)  A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, 
    the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration 
    and see what command is being executed.

    NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. 
    This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat 
    this level!

    NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, 
    so you may want to keep a copy around…


HINTS:
------
cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use “man 5 crontab” to access this)
